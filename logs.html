		<h1>Maintenance Logs</h1>
		<p>
		These are maintenance logs I've written for the Columbia Makerspace. While they are specific to our lab, some equipment information may be valuable. They are all hosted on Slack's post system, since they were originally written for our Slack channel. Please feel free to contact me with questions or corrections.

This log documents the steps taken to return the cutter into clean, working condition.

			<li><b><a href="https://slack-files.com/T9J4S4BNH-F9Q8N98E4-a571cb9851">3/15/18 Sewing Machine Bobbin Case</a></b> <br>The Singer 5532 sewing machine is stitching inconsistently and chewing up thread. The wheel turns rough manually. The bobbin case isn't rotating correctly and getting caught, so it needs to be replaced.</li>
			<li><b><a href="https://slack-files.com/T9J4S4BNH-F9QACK1AM-9676403e9f">3/15/18 Laser Cutter PSU Diagnosis</a></b> <br>Our Thunderlaser Nova 51 suddenly stops cutting, even though the head traces the design correctly. I document the process of diagnosing the exact issue, which is a blown laser PSU. A replacement is on its way.</li>
			<li><b><a href="https://slack-files.com/T9J4S4BNH-F9QM4JWCX-97699522e1">3/14/18 3D Printer Broken Fan</a></b> <br>An incorrectly run fan cable from a previous head rebuild is inevitably caught between joints and cut. I disassemble the head and replace the fan, this time running the cable correctly. Ultimaker 3 Extended.</li>
			<li><b><a href="https://slack-files.com/T9J4S4BNH-F9JBX8WTB-68668f1ce1">3/5/18 3D Printer Askew Axis</a></b> <br>Askew sliders cause prints to be slightly skewed, resulting in boxes with non-90deg corners. Repositioning the slider results in a quick fix. Ultimaker 2+ Extended.</li>
